<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# üìñ Insurance DeFi<a name="about-project"></a>

The project addresses DeFi risks with a decentralized insurance protocol in Solidity. It encompasses two main components: crypto wallet insurance and collateral protection for crypto-backed loans. Users pay monthly premiums, determined by the protocol, and receive interest for contributing liquidity. The system follows a factory contract model for individualized user contracts, allowing users to pay premiums and initiate claims with necessary checks. Testnet usage is recommended for comprehensive testing of the protocol's functionality and security.

## üõ† Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>
This Eccomerce DApp is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- **Solidity:** The programming language used for developing Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Hardhat** It is a development environment for Ethereum smart contracts, providing a flexible, efficient, and extensible toolkit for building and testing decentralized applications.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** The programming language employed for crafting the application's logic.
- **Git:** A version control system for tracking changes in the codebase and facilitating collaboration.
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform for hosting the project's Git repository and enabling code sharing and collaboration.
- **npm:** The package manager for installing and managing project dependencies.
- **VS Code:** A popular code editor with excellent support for JavaScript and React development.
<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>


1. **Dual Insurance Components:**
- The protocol includes distinct contracts for crypto wallet insurance and collateral protection for crypto-backed loans.
2. **Premium Payment System:**
- Users pay monthly premiums to secure their smart contract wallets against potential risks, with premium amounts determined by the protocol.
3. **Liquidity Provision and Interest:**
- Participants providing liquidity for insurance coverage receive interest, incentivizing contributions to the insurance pool.
4. **Factory Contract Model:**
- The system follows a factory contract model, deploying separate insurance contracts for each user, enhancing modularity and individualized coverage.
5. **Claim Initiation with Checks:**
- Users have the ability to initiate claims by paying premiums and undergoing necessary checks, ensuring a streamlined and secure claims process.
6. **Testnet Integration:**
- Testnet usage is recommended for thorough testing, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the protocol before deployment on the mainnet.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üíª Installation and setup <a name="getting-started"></a>


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
